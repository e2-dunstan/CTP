# Rigidbody Dynamics Engine with an Integrated Path Tracer 
### A Creative Technologies Project by Ellie Dunstan

#### Controls:

- Hold right mouse button to pan the camera, and WASD to move around the scene.
- 'M' throws a sphere.
- 'P' toggles the physics simulation (basically a pause button).
- 'R' starts a new path-tracing render (in Visual Studio only).

- The direction and velocity of the sphere can be modified in Engine::ThrowSphere()
- The items that spawn in the scene can be modified in Engine::Init()
